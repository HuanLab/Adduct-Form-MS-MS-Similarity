# Adduct-Based MS/MS Analysis and Visualization Pipeline

This repository contains a complete workflow for analyzing and visualizing adduct-specific MS/MS spectral similarity using R scripts.

---

##  Workflow Overview

1. **Step1_Adduct_Sorting.R**  
   Organizes MS/MS data by adduct types from input spectral libraries.

2. **Step2_Finding_the_Adduct_Pairs.R**  
   Identifies all valid adduct pairings based on metadata and collision energy matching.

3. **Step3_Similarity_Calculation.R**  
   Calculates cosine similarity (and optionally modified versions) between MS/MS spectra across adduct pairs.

Once Steps 1â€“3 are complete, you can generate specific figures using the scripts below.
